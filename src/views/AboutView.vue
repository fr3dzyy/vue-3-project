    Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and
    published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA),
    which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III:
    Reign of Chaos.

    Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each
    team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the
    ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a "hero".
    There are currently 122 possible heroes to choose from, each with unique
    abilities and differing styles of play. During a match players collect
    experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the
    opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being
    the first to destroy the other team's "Ancient", a large structure located
    within their base.
